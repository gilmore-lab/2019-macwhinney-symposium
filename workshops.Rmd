It depends on the `googlesheets` package, documented here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/basic-usage.html>

```{r}
library(googlesheets)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Download registrations from Google sheet

```{r}
ws_url <- "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tN5qri9YV6JjLO4nNoG6OmtTFl78NxBl941SlhKTqhI"
ws_name <- "Symposium In Honor of Brian MacWhinney (Responses)"
ws_key <- "1tN5qri9YV6JjLO4nNoG6OmtTFl78NxBl941SlhKTqhI/"

mw <- googlesheets::gs_title(ws_name)
```

## Print workshop registrations

```{r}
workshops <- mw %>%
  gs_read(ws = 'Workshop Registration')
